Data and Analytics Steps
1. Data Collection

Data was collected from multiple sources, including:

Metro operational systems (ridership counts, line usage).

Asset and infrastructure databases (stations per line).

Operational performance reports (reliability rate, launch duration).

2. Data Integration

All datasets were consolidated into a unified data model:

Passenger data linked to metro lines.

Station data mapped to each line.

Time-based operational indicators standardized to the same reporting period (2025).

3. Data Cleaning

Data quality processes included:

Removing duplicate records.

Handling missing or incomplete passenger counts.

Standardizing line names, colors, and station identifiers.

Validating totals (e.g., sum of passengers per line equals total passengers).

4. Data Transformation

Key transformations were applied:

Aggregating passenger counts by line.

Calculating percentages for each line’s contribution.

Deriving KPIs such as “Most Used Line” and “Operational Reliability Rate.”

Formatting values (millions, percentages, months).

5. Data Modeling

A simple analytical model was created:

Fact tables for passenger movements.

Dimension tables for lines, stations, and time.

Relationships defined to enable cross-filtering between visuals.

6. Visualization & Dashboard Design

Visuals were designed to support fast insights:

KPI cards for high-level indicators.

Map visualization for spatial distribution of stations.

Pie chart to show passenger distribution by line.

Bar chart to highlight the most used metro lines.

7. Validation & Review

Final outputs were reviewed to ensure:

Accuracy of figures.

Consistency between visuals and KPIs.

Alignment with business and operational objectives.
